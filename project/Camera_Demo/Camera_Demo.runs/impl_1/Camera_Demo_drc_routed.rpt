Net MIPI_Trans_Driver/Driver_Bayer_To_RGB0/o_led_rgb_data_reg[0]_47[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin MIPI_Trans_Driver/Driver_Bayer_To_RGB0/temp_rgb_data_reg[2][23]_i_1/O, cell MIPI_Trans_Driver/Driver_Bayer_To_RGB0/temp_rgb_data_reg[2][23]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
