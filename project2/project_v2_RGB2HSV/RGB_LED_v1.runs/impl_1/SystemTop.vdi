WARNING: [DRC BUFC-1] Input Buffer Connections: Input buffer Camera_IIC_SDA_IOBUF/IBUF has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net MIPI_Trans_Driver/Driver_Bayer_To_RGB0/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin MIPI_Trans_Driver/Driver_Bayer_To_RGB0/p_cnt_reg[30]_i_1/O, cell MIPI_Trans_Driver/Driver_Bayer_To_RGB0/p_cnt_reg[30]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net MIPI_Trans_Driver/Driver_Bayer_To_RGB0/set_x_o_reg[4]_0[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin MIPI_Trans_Driver/Driver_Bayer_To_RGB0/color_num_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell MIPI_Trans_Driver/Driver_Bayer_To_RGB0/color_num_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net color_judge_HSV/p_cnt_reg[0]/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin color_judge_HSV/p_cnt_reg[0]/L3_2/O, cell color_judge_HSV/p_cnt_reg[0]/L3_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
