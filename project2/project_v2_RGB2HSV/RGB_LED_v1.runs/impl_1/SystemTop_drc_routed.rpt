2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
BUFC-1#1 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer Camera_IIC_SDA_IOBUF/IBUF (in Camera_IIC_SDA_IOBUF macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net MIPI_Trans_Driver/Driver_Bayer_To_RGB0/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin MIPI_Trans_Driver/Driver_Bayer_To_RGB0/p_cnt_reg[30]_i_1/O, cell MIPI_Trans_Driver/Driver_Bayer_To_RGB0/p_cnt_reg[30]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net MIPI_Trans_Driver/Driver_Bayer_To_RGB0/set_x_o_reg[4]_0[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin MIPI_Trans_Driver/Driver_Bayer_To_RGB0/color_num_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell MIPI_Trans_Driver/Driver_Bayer_To_RGB0/color_num_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net color_judge_HSV/p_cnt_reg[0]/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin color_judge_HSV/p_cnt_reg[0]/L3_2/O, cell color_judge_HSV/p_cnt_reg[0]/L3_2 (in color_judge_HSV/p_cnt_reg[0] macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>
